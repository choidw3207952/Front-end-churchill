      <h2>Introduction Churchill House</h2>
      <br>
      <img src="assets/img/churchill-house-11.jpg" alt="Map">
      <p><strong>Churchill House</strong>, at 216 Northbourne Avenue in Braddon, was <strong>designed by Robin Boyd</strong> for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia in 1969-70, and construction was completed in 1971. It was Boyd’s last major commission, and he died prior to its completion. It is one of a small number of larger designs produced by Boyd and was Canberra’s first brutalist building.</p>

      <p><Strong>Several components make up the complex.</Strong> The <strong>main building</strong>, with <strong>east and south wings</strong>; the separate <strong>north wing or pavilion</strong>; the <strong>central pool and a rear carpark</strong>. The <strong>main building forms an L shape and with the north wing</strong> it encloses a courtyard with a large ornamental pool. The <strong>main building</strong> is three storeys high with a four storey lift tower at the southeast corner. The <strong>north wing and the carpark</strong> are two storeyed.</p>
            
      <p>Although it has undergone some alterations over the years, the building still displays key features of the brutalist style with its large areas of blank wall and use off-form concrete, sloping structural fins and precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels, precast fins for sun protection, and vertical slit windows. <br><br><br><strong>Churchill House displays a fairly restrained form in comparison <br>with the major Canberra buildings that followed in this style:</strong></p> <ul><li> - Cameron Offices</li> <li> - National Gallery of Australia</li>  <li> - High Court of Australia</li></ul>

        <h2>The Architect: Robin Boyd</h2><br>
        <img src="assets/img/extra2-robin_boyd_portrait-copyright-Mark-Strizic.jpg" alt="Robin Boyd">
        <p><strong>Robin Gerard Penleigh Boyd</strong> (1919-1971) was a nationally and internationally renowned architect. He was also widely published and appreciated as an architectural critic. In 1953 Robin Boyd, Roy Grounds and Frederick Romberg formed the practice of Grounds, Romberg and Boyd which became a leading architectural firm in Melbourne. The firm also practiced extensively in Canberra.<br>
            <br>
            Although the three partners were prominent as individuals, the firm maintained a strong design unity. Some buildings revealed the hand of one or other of the architects, but in general the firm developed a corporate style, combining the philosophies of the trio and representing the advanced thinking of that era. They often worked or supervised on each other’s projects. Their work was a distinctive Australian form of the International Style, then called Contemporary. (Clerehan, 1993)<br>
            <br>
            Boyd joined the National Capital Planning Committee (NCPC) in January 1968 as one of two architectural experts, the other being Professor Gordon Stephenson from Western Australia. Boyd and Stephenson were charged with creating a statement of civic design philosophy that would form the basis of the NCDC policies relating to the Buildings (Design and Siting) Ordinance 1964. These policies would guide the aesthetic, development principles and layout of buildings in the National Capital areas of Canberra.<br>
            <br><br>
            <strong>Boyd had a prolific output of architectural designs, books and articles.</strong> <br>He wrote over 700 articles for journals and newspapers, presented a TV series on Modernism and was the author of <br><br><strong>Victorian Modern:</strong><br> 111 Years of modern Architecture in the State of Victoria, Australia (1947); <br><br><strong>Australia’s Home:</strong><br> Its Origins, Builders and Occupiers (1952); <br>The Australian Ugliness (1960); <br>Kenzo Tange (1962); <br><br><strong>The Walls Around Us:</strong><br> The Story of Australian Architecture (1962); <br>The Puzzle of Architecture (1965); <br>New Directions in Japanese Architecture (1968); <br>Living In Australia (1970); <br>The Great Great Australian Dream (1972 posthumously). <br><br>
            <br>
            His architectural work is mostly known through his residential designs. He was known for his ability to design houses that would meet client needs, solve site problems and still retain architectural integrity. The designs were heavily influenced by the functional and international styles of architecture and became known as the Melbourne Regional style. It was light, simple and elegant and unmistakably modern. (Architecture Today 1972; Saunders 1972; and Serle 1995)</p>
