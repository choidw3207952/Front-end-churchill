              <p><strong>Churchill House</strong> was designed by Robin Boyd for the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust of Australia in 1969-70 and construction was completed in 1971.<br> The building is an example of the Late Twentieth-Century Brutalist Style (1960-) with its large areas of blank wall and off-form concrete.</p>
              <p><strong>The complex comprises a number of components:</strong> <br></p><ul><li>- the main building with its east and south wings</li> <li>- the separate north wing or pavilion</li> <li>- the pool and the rear carpark</li></ul><br><br> <p>The main building forms an <strong>L shape</strong> in plan, and with the north wing it encloses on three sides a courtyard in which the pool is located.<br> The <strong>main building</strong> is of three storeys with a four storey lift tower at the southeast corner, the <strong>north wing</strong> is of two storeys, and the <strong>carpark</strong> is two storeyed.</p>

              <p>The main building displays several different elevational treatments. The elevations facing onto the pool area feature floor to ceiling glass with minimal black metal frames to the lowest level, and precast vertical panels on the upper two storeys.<br>Each panel has a projecting fin and are relatively narrow, with the overall affect being of closely spaced vertical fins. Beside the fins are narrow, slot windows providing minimal outlook onto the pool area.</p>
              <p>The <strong>south and east elevations</strong> are quite different in character having long horizontal sections of flush-mounted glazing set in minimal black metal frames, with timber-textured off-form concrete spandrels between storeys. The base course of the elevation is a large section black-coated steel beam.<br> Several window-mounted airconditioners are located on the south elevation. The blank end walls of the wings and the lift tower are off-form, timber-textured concrete with incised storey lines.</p>
              <p>At the <strong>junction of the two wings</strong> are the foyers for each floor as well as the service core including the lift. Apart from the off-form concrete walls of the service elements, the foyers feature glazing set in black metal frames which extends the full height of the building. At the ground floor level the glazing is vertical but above that for the remaining two storeys it is sloping.</p>
              <p>The <strong>building</strong> has concrete slab floors which are either carpeted or finished in slate. Some interior walls are textured, off-form concrete similar to the exterior. Other walls are lightweight partitions. <br><br><strong>There is a mixture of ceiling treatments:</strong> <br></p><ul><li>- off-form concrete</li> <li>- suspended ceilings and set plasterboard</li></ul> <p><br>Many of the interior fitouts appear relatively modern and are not original.</p>
              <p><br>The <strong>roof</strong> of the main building is set behind a parapet and appears to be graded concrete with a membrane coating.</p>

              <p>&emsp;&emsp;- Sloping structural fins, being the structural steel members supporting the glazing at the corner between the east and south wings.<br><br>

                <h2>Statement of Signifigance</h2><br>
                <p>Churchill House is a good example of the Late Twentieth Century Brutalist style(1960-). <br><br>displaying several <strong>key features</strong> as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>- Large areas of blank wall, especially the west wall of the south wing.</li>
                <li>- Off-form concrete, such as the west wall of the south wing and the spandrels to the south and east wings.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>In addition, it displays a number of the <strong>other features of this style</strong> including:<br></p> <ul><li>- sloping structural fins</li> <li>- precast concrete non-loadbearing wall panels</li> <li>- precast fins for sun protection,</li> <li>- vertical slit windows</li></ul>
                <p>Churchill House is one of several Canberra examples of this style, and one of only two which display a restrained form reflecting, perhaps, a more conservative approach to the style because of the intended office use.</p><br>
                <p>The architecture of this building may contribute to the education of designers in their understanding of Late Twentieth-Century Architectural Styles.</p>
                <p>Churchill House has interest for its association with the prominent architect, Robin Boyd. The building was his last major commission.</p>
